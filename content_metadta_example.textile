Example: Course > Talk > S3Content & Uploaded Video

h2. Course 

At this level, we need URLs & metadata from content that's actually managed 2 layers down -- ie. the URL, mimetype & title of S3Content within each Talk in this Course

Course View Wants: 

* a list of Talks with urls for +the+ content (ie streaming url) for each Talk
* info to tell you whether to render audio player, video player, or regular download link for each talk URL

h2. Talk

Talk view wants:

* a player for +the+ content of the talk (stored as S3Content, Uploaded Video, etc.) -- need Title, URL and file size
* a list of supplemental files -- need Title, URL and file size
* info to tell you whether to render audio player, video player, or regular download link for each file URL

h2. S3Content

Extra curveball -- the urls for secure S3 content are time-sensitive; you must use the S3 API to generate a fresh authenticated URL when you display it to your users.
